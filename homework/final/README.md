# The Final Project

The final project can be one or many pages. It should be the culmination of your knowledge and experience in this class. It should be polished. Above all, you should be proud and eager to show it to your friends and/or peers.

## Week 7 - Drafting an Idea

Deadline: 8am on Monday, April 21

Requirements:
- Modify the `README.md` in your `final` folder to describe your final project
  - Further instructions included in that file

The goal is to have something written down we can discuss, so I can tell you ahead of time if it's too modest / difficult.

## Week 8 - Begin prototyping

Deadline: 8am on Monday, April 28

Requirements:
- Add a link to your new repo on your final document (the same README from last week)
- Upload a working draft website to your repo

This is so I can get a picture of the direction you're taking, and we can discuss technical challenges.

This is also when I'll set explicit requirements for each individual project (eg You're making a portfolio? It needs this and that)

## Week 9 - Submit the Final Project

Deadline: 8am on Tuesday, May 5th

Upload your completed project before class, we will be doing live demos

Each project's requirements will vary based on the job they're trying to tackle, but all of them must satisfy at least these criteria:

- An `index.html` file
  - Zero or more other `HTML` files
  - Each `HTML` file must have a `<title>`, `<favicon>`, and working `<meta>` tags
- One or more `CSS` files
- One or more `JS` files
- All links/images must work
- No javascript errors in the inspection console during expected use

The goal is to make something professional and polished

### IF YOUR SITE IS NOT PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE OR IS BROKEN, YOU WILL FAIL THE FINAL
