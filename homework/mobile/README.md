## Assignment

Create a mobile friendly site that has user interaction

The requirements are:

- HTML must have title and favicon (`<meta>` social tags optional)
- HTML must have viewport meta tag
  - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`
- Use a CSS media query to change styles and/or hide elements
- The page must look good and be functional on both desktop and mobile
  - I will be grading by how it looks in the Inspect Tool on an iPhone 6
- The user can click on something and change the content of the page
- Use at least one CSS transition, see the [example from class](/lectures/week6/review)

Upload the following to `students/<yourname>/interactive/` by 8am on Monday, May 14

- `index.html`
- a `css` file for styling
- a `js` file for user interaction

## Tips
- Totally stuck? Try inspecting the page and checking the Console for errors, and use the line number:
