## Assignment

Use javascript and the canvas to draw a picture.

Requirements:
- Your HTML file should include the following:
  - Title
  - Favicon made from a screenshot of your picture
  - Meta tags
- Your drawn image should include at least the following:
  - One rectangle, drawn with `ctx.strokeRect()` or `ctx.fillRect()`
  - One circle or curve, drawn with `ctx.arc()`
  - One polygon, drawn with `ctx.moveTo()` and `ctx.lineTo()`

Upload the following to `students/<yourname>/canvas/` by 8am on Monday, April 30
- `index.html`
- a `css` file to remove the page's default margins
- a `js` file for drawing the picture

## Tips
- Guide on how to use [<canvas>](canvas.md)
- Strings, like colors and hex codes, needs quotes around them like `"this"`, but variable names like `canvas` and numbers don't need quotes
- Totally stuck? Try inspecting the page and checking the Console for errors:
