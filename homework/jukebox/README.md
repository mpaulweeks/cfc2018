## Assignment

Create a web page that plays audio and looks good when you share it.

Requirements:
- HTML must have title and favicon
- HTML must have `<meta>` tags for social
- The page must play music, either automatically or via user intervention
  - Using either `<audio>` or an embedded video is fine

Upload the following to `students/<yourname>/jukebox/` by 8am on Monday, May 14
- `index.html`
- a `css` file for styling
- any related/necessary audio files
- (optional) `js` file for interaction

## Tips

- See [canvas homework](/homework/canvas) for tips on the `<meta>` tags
- Read more about the [`<audio>` tag documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio)
- If trying to add autoplay to an embedded YouTube video, check [this useful thread on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3405242/how-can-i-autoplay-a-video-using-the-new-embed-code-style-for-youtube)
