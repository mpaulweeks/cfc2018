## Project Description

A world map that shows all the places I have lived and travelled. When you hover on a highlighted country, the information on the travels will show up on a box. The map will be color coded, based off if I lived there, travelled there before 18, or after 18. 

## Project Requirements

1 HTML file, 1 JS file, 1 CSS file. I will need an image of the world map (flat not globe), and also the highlighted countries cut out so that they can serve as buttons to set off the hover. Or if it's possible to do that with just the map and no buttons that also works. 

## Plan for Mobile Differences

Since maps are so big, and there will be a lot of specific details going into it, I worry that it would get lost on mobile, so this project would have to live on desktop.
