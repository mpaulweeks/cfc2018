    I am a <span style="font-weight:bold"> <span style="color:#006045">maltese shih-tzu mix</span></span>, which is why I am this cute. Also, I was born on the <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="color:#006045">day of love</span></span> (February 14th) so I was just made to be loveable.
    My favorite pass time is chasing <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="color:#006045">squirrels</span></span>, although I do enjoy scratches and ball catching as well. Most of my days are spent <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="color:#006045">sleeping</span></span>, but when I am awake I have tons of energy and will run after any flying object.

    If you're interested in being my friend, and want to chase some balls together, please let my dog sitter, Diane, know. She can bring me over for a play date.
    You could even bring me a toy we can play with together! You can check out a few of my favorites <a href="https://www.chewy.com/b/chew-toys-316?rh=c:316,&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzIzWBRDnARIsAAkc8hEG7NHfkDszwb_rl5lzmH4Yn1oSjHWTi1LbsA0VAeWDX3UiN1Y6rLoaAvymEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds" style="color:#006045">here</a>.
