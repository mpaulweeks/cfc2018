[Assignment details](/homework/final)

Edit this document on GitHub. _Only edit the text in parentheses._ Feel free to add more at the bottom.

## Project Description

BTS "Love Yourself: Her" Album Website
With landing page, a distinct page for each song on the album that tells one story, interactive worldwide map of tour locations & dates, connect page (links to social media, comment box, and spotify), a page with some fun content (graphic score, fan art, etc.)

## Project Requirements

Number of HTML files: 13 (landing page, one for each of the 9 songs, tour with dates, connect, & fun content)
Whether you will use JS: yes - to show the fan chants and to show the dates for each city they go to on their tour
Any images/media you will need: lots of bts images, videos and music

## Plan for Mobile Differences

Will shrink it things down to just one column. Instead of using an interactive map for the tour, I'll probably just have it as a list.

# Feedback

- portfolio is ok, JS will be minimal so focus on the polish
- header/footer, consistent design on different sized screens
- throw in some CSS transitions/animations, for example in nav song dropdown
- nav is great start, also songs to link to each other in order (ie next/prev)
- dont force anything from class that would out of place (eg dark mode)
- center things by giving max-width (eg 600px), then `margin: 0px auto;`

## For next week

- polished nav and general website style
- homepage and 2 songs as examples
- custom font working locally and on uploaded github site
