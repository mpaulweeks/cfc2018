[Assignment details](/homework/final)

Edit this document on GitHub. _Only edit the text in parentheses._ Feel free to add more at the bottom.

## Project Description

BTS "Love Yourself: Her" Album Website
With landing page, a distinct page for each song on the album that tells one story, interactive worldwide map of tour locations & dates, connect page (links to social media, comment box, and spotify), a page with some fun content (graphic score, fan art, etc.)

## Project Requirements

Number of HTML files: 13 (landing page, one for each of the 9 songs, tour with dates, connect, & fun content)
Whether you will use JS: yes - to show the fan chants and to show the dates for each city they go to on their tour
Any images/media you will need: lots of bts images, videos and music

## Plan for Mobile Differences

Will shrink it things down to just one column. Instead of using an interactive map for the tour, I'll probably just have it as a list.
