  Kim Tae Hyung is a beloved member of Korean Pop group BTS.
  Tae Hyung debuted as a "mystery member" and almost didn't make it to the group.
  He claims that he would've been a farmer if he didn't make it as a singer.
  Tae Hyung's favorite brand is Gucci but for some reason he just really likes wearing pajamas in public.
  Most of the time, he doesn't know what's going on - especially when he's filming vlogs with the other members.
  The other members consider him to be 10% genius and 90% idiot, which makes him all the more endearing to his fans.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  Fun fact: Tae Hyung likes to talk to (and reply to) himself while doing chores.
