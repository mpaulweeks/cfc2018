  <p class="thoughts">
      This week I read the first half of a book called <span class="italics"> Don’t Make Me Think. </span>
      It was a fairly easy read and I learned a lot.
  </p>

  <p class="bulletsintro">
      Here are some of my thoughts and takeaways:

  <p>
    <ul>
        - <span class="bold"> Websites should make obvious what is clickable. </span> Lately I’ve noticed that knowing what is clickable and what is not is can only be determined once a user hovers over it. This bothers me because you can’t tell if anything is clickable on devices where you can’t hover (phones and tablets).
    </ul>
    <ul>
        - <span class="bold"> Reading sucks. </span> So articles that are short, bulleted and contain lots of pictures definitely make the reading process more enjoyable. A great example of this is buzzfeed.
    </ul>
    <ul>
        - I used to think a lot about the number of clicks it takes a user to accomplish a task. But after reading the chapter on <span class="italics"> Why Users Like Mindless Choices </span> I know realize that I care more about how <span class="bold"> painless a process is over how many clicks it takes to complete a task. </span>
    </ul>
