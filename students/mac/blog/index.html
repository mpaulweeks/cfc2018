    Don't Make Me Think
  </h3>

  <div class="bodytext">
    Don’t make me think. According to Steve Krug, this is the number one rule to remember when designing a user-friendly website or app.
    In his book by the same name, he goes into detail about the dos and don’ts of design etiquette.
    Although first printed in 2000, the version I read was revisited in 2014 and so it has a
    decent grasp on the landscape of today’s web.<br><br>
The subject matter of the book is uninteresting to me in an interesting way; like most in my generation (the internet babies),
I need no instruction manual when encountering a new interface or program. I speak that language, so to say, and can feel my
way through context clues. So literature on web navigation isn’t exactly on my checklist. That said,
having my everyday actions put into words is interesting.<br><br>
I especially enjoyed the contrasting ways designers and users
see web pages described in chapter 2. Designers making their pages and pieces know
and care about each paragraph, word, and link. But the scanning user on a mission
filters out much of that information. Though simplistic, the graphics really get the point across and
I liked this section’s blurred illustration.<br><br>
Have to admit I was scanning this page myself, and found it ironic that in the section
talking about “trigger words that are hardwired into our nervous systems,”
my eyes jumped immediately to “Sex,” an example he gives in that paragraph.
I also enjoyed the discussion of web design conventions.<br><br>
He doesn’t do too deep of a dive, but I find the topic of evolving web interfaces
fascinating. Exciting time to be alive & can’t wait to tell my grand kids
about the ancient scrollbar, etc.
