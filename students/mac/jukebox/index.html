<div class="lyrics">
  Well, I met you at the blood bank<br>
We were looking at the bags<br>
Wondering if any of the colors<br>
Matched any of the names we knew on the tags<br><br>
You said "see lookit, that's yours<br>
Stacked on top with your brother's<br>
See how they resemble one another<br>
Even in their plastic little covers"<br><br>
And I said I know it well<br><br>
That secret that you knew<br>
But don't know how to tell<br>
It fucks with your honor<br>
And it teases your head<br>
But you know that it's good, girl<br>
'Cause its running you with red<br><br>
Then the snow started falling<br>
We were stuck out in your car<br>
You were rubbing both of my hands<br>
Chewing on a candy bar<br><br>
You said "ain't this just like the present<br>
To be showing up like this"<br>
As a moon waned to crescent<br>
We started to kiss<br><br>
And I said I know it well<br><br>
That secret that we know<br>
That we don't know how to tell<br>
I'm in love with your honor<br>
I'm in love with your cheeks<br>
What's that noise up the stairs babe?<br>
Is that Christmas morning creaks?<br><br>
And I said I know it well<br>
And I know it well<br>
And I know it well<br>
And I know it well<br>
And I know it well<br>
And I know it well<br>
And I know it well<br>
And I know it well<br>
