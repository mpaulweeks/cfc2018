## Project Description

(what the website will do, information it will provide, user flow)

My buddies and I have been nursing a nice addiction to Fortnite these past few months so I thought I might make a "tool" for us. At the beginning of each round, players have to select what area of the map to parachute to, colloquially phrased "Where we droppin' bois?" For my final I'd like to create an interactive map that essentially functions like a Magic 8 Ball. Users will be greeted by the map along with a nice big button (I'd like it to be slightly more complext than a simple press, if possible, ie hold for 3 seconds. Also would like to add a sound effect for the button's activation). Interacting with the button will give users the following randomized information: Where We Droppin', Projected Loot, and what place you finish at.

## Project Requirements

(number of HTML files, whether you will use JS, any images/media you will need)

I think actually only 1 HTML file will do for this purpose. Definitely going to need to use JS--glad we covered the randomized javascript in class already. Image of the map as well as sound effect from the game for the button activation. 

## Plan for Mobile Differences

(can you adjust your design for mobile, and how will that work? otherwise if it a lost cause, how would you plan to inform your user to view it on desktop?)
The map is landscape oriented so might look strange on a phone. So I think for mobile I could ditch the map image, and just have a button that delivers the aforementioned information.
