## Project Description

My buddies and I have been nursing a nice addiction to Fortnite these past few months so I thought I might make a "tool" for us. At the beginning of each round, players have to select what area of the map to parachute to, colloquially phrased "Where we droppin' bois?" For my final I'd like to create an interactive map that essentially functions like a Magic 8 Ball. Users will be greeted by the map along with a nice big button (I'd like it to be slightly more complext than a simple press, if possible, ie hold for 3 seconds. Also would like to add a sound effect for the button's activation). Interacting with the button will give users the following randomized information: Where We Droppin', Projected Loot, and what place you finish at.

## Project Requirements

I think actually only 1 HTML file will do for this purpose. Definitely going to need to use JS--glad we covered the randomized javascript in class already. Image of the map as well as sound effect from the game for the button activation. 

## Plan for Mobile Differences

The map is landscape oriented so might look strange on a phone. So I think for mobile I could ditch the map image, and just have a button that delivers the aforementioned information. 

# Feedback

- idea is fine
- see random example uploaded next to this readme
- stretch goal: hold button
- on first screen, map should be large
- on split screen, map should match width of its column
- great opportunity for transition on width
- center button on top of image, use background color to stand out, hide on click

## For next week

- Polish up the display
- Make sure 2+ random generators are working
