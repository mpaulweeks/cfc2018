  <div class="text hidden"> AI is scary. That is all. </div>

  <div class="button" id="buttonOne"> Scary </div>
  <div class="info hidden" id="infoOne"> The way we personify machines scares me. The title of this YouTube clip is a perfect example; it's called, "How Machines Learn." The video goes on to talk about how people who build bots don't like to talk about them because they're a valuable "employee." </div>

  <div class="button" id="buttonTwo"> Exciting </div>
  <div class="info hidden" id="infoTwo"> It is kind of cool that algorithmic bots are able to do so much and have advanced astronomically in recent years. Although, it's weird that how the algorithmic bots work is a mystery, even to the humans who built them.  </div>

  <div class="button" id="buttonThree"> Questions and Criticism </div>
  <div class="info hidden" id="infoThree"> No real criticism here, but I do wonder what the world will look like in a few years with these bots. Will their introduction into other avenues of our lives make them valuable or detrimental? Only time will tell. Stay tuned...  </div>
