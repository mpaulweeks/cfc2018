## Project Description

To preface: I know this is going to sound a bit bizarre, but it's a continuation for a project from another class.

My copywriter partner and I came up with an idea to create a fake porn site for Sour Patch Kids and Deadpool, in order to promote the release of Deadpool 2. We've already created a fake mock-up site called, "Deadpoolssourpatch.com." My goal for this final assignment is to make this site actually work, so when people click on it, it will take them to a ridiculous page full of foolishness (on point with Deadpool's humor).

## Project Requirements

3-4 HTML files: 1 for the home page, 1 for news about Sour Patch Kids and Deadpool, and 1 for other Product Creations merging the two brands. 1 CSS file. 1 JS file. Images of the "leaked sex tape" between SPK and DP and other images relating to the site.

## Plan for Mobile Differences

It should be able to be viewed on mobile.
