## Project Description

To preface: I know this is going to sound a bit bizarre, but it's a continuation for a project from another class.

My copywriter partner and I came up with an idea to create a fake porn site for Sour Patch Kids and Deadpool, in order to promote the release of Deadpool 2. We've already created a fake mock-up site called, "Deadpoolssourpatch.com." My goal for this final assignment is to make this site actually work, so when people click on it, it will take them to a ridiculous page full of foolishness (on point with Deadpool's humor).

## Project Requirements

3-4 HTML files: 1 for the home page, 1 for news about Sour Patch Kids and Deadpool, and 1 for other Product Creations merging the two brands. 1 CSS file. 1 JS file. Images of the "leaked sex tape" between SPK and DP and other images relating to the site.

## Plan for Mobile Differences

It should be able to be viewed on mobile.

# Feedback

- sounds like a portfolio site
- ok if minimal to no JS, but should be incredibly polished
- links should work, even if sending to bogus places
- header/footer should look nice and official
- optimize for mobile by probably making seperate assets and then displaying one or the other via CSS media queries

## For next week

- 2+ pages that link to each other
- nav and footer (ok if incomplete)
- get working example of asset switch on mobile (mock images ok)
