  A web designer must read.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So far, I am 5 chapters deep and it has taught me so much! My overall take away so far is that less is more- you want to keep your web design simple and readable. No one wants to be confused.
<br>
If you are looking to design a website and need some guidance how to make sure the user experience usability is seamless, this book will be your new best friend!
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Three good tips to take away from this reading:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You want to make the user experience enjoyable. Have your page straight forward. Nothing is worse than going to a website and you don’t know how to navigate the page! Make what needs to be clickable visible and easy to find. You don’t want people leaving your page because of bad design!
<br>
<br>
 When people visit a website, your scans the page and filters through what elements you will need to navigate through a page and what you don’t. I never notice myself but when I also enter a new webpage, the first thing I do is scan the page and find key words that will help me engage with the site better.
 <br>
 <br>
Show what is necessary. Don’t over design, reducing noise on the website is the way to go. You don’t want to fill the page with a bunch of crap! Remember you are designing a page for the user, NOT yourself.
