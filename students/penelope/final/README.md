## Project Description 

(This be a website where it shuffles random tarot cards for the user and depending on the cards and what comes up- it will tell the user general information on the card and they can come up with a conclusion about their future. If this is too basic for the final project, I will create a blog with crystal information (similar to my mobile app) and other "spiritual things")

## Project Requirements

(many tarot deck have about 78 cards- I will about 78 cards to shuffle through. this will be shuffled through with javascript. I am not sure if I should have a webpage with the meaning of each card or when the cards shuffle through the deck the image and meaning will pop up together.)

## Plan for Mobile Differences

(It will have a mobile version)
