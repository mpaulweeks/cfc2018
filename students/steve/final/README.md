## Project Description

(what the website will do, information it will provide, user flow-____I always run into an annoyance when referencing my color palettes for a project. It would be nice to have a non-adobe cc based source for color themes and their corresponding RGB and HEX values. I propose making a page that includes color themes. Each comprised of primary and a secondary colors with dark and light variants of each so you can apply in different ways. 
- may include a super basic image slideshow with an autoplay feature as a reference to each theme. Would come in handy for moodboarding )

## Project Requirements

(number of HTML files, whether you will use JS, any images/media you will need-__i'll use 1 html file most likely, unless i include the image slideshow then I will link to a second page. Both would have basic JS. I'll need the color palettes which I have on Adobe CC and Capture, create about 10-20 different color themes. if I do corresponding moodboard images then I would need those 10-20 images  )

## Plan for Mobile Differences

(can you adjust your design for mobile, and how will that work? otherwise if it a lost cause, how would you plan to inform your user to view it on desktop? -- ___yes I can adjust my design for mobile.Instead of having two columns of palettes on desktop version I can collaspe them into one for mobile (or smaller window sizes) )
