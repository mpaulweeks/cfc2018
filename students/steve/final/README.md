## Project Description

I always run into an annoyance when referencing my color palettes for a project. It would be nice to have a non-adobe cc based source for color themes and their corresponding RGB and HEX values. I propose making a page that includes color themes. Each comprised of primary and a secondary colors with dark and light variants of each so you can apply in different ways. 
- may include a super basic image slideshow with an autoplay feature as a reference to each theme. Would come in handy for moodboarding

## Project Requirements

i'll use 1 html file most likely, unless i include the image slideshow then I will link to a second page. Both would have basic JS. I'll need the color palettes which I have on Adobe CC and Capture, create about 10-20 different color themes. if I do corresponding moodboard images then I would need those 10-20 images

## Plan for Mobile Differences

yes I can adjust my design for mobile.Instead of having two columns of palettes on desktop version I can collaspe them into one for mobile (or smaller window sizes)

# Feedback

- strong idea
- each palette should have an enclosing div, with title and meta info like links
- display the hex codes in text somehow
- global toggle to hide/show hex vs rgb codes
- stretch goal: click to copy to keyboard

## For next week

- 3+ color palettes working on different sized screens
- get the global toggle working for hex vs rgb display
