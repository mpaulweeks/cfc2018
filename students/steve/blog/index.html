    Don't Make Me Think: The Commentary
  </h1>
  <div class="main">
    “Don’t make me think” refers to the idea that when a web site makes you stop and think about what you’re doing, it’s making your life harder, and perhaps isn’t designed as well as it could be.



  <div class="main">
    Things that make you think add to your brain’s workload. It might not be much, but these things add up, so every bit of clarity that can be added is welcome. Nobody likes feeling like they’re not sure what to do.
    Not everything can always be self-evident. If not, settle for self-explanatory.
    Most people don’t read an entire web page, but simply scan it for the first thing that looks good, which they then proceed to click. People don’t attempt a thorough understanding of a web site, but prefer to satisfice - making do with what seems like pretty good choices.

Therefore:
</div>
<br>
<ul class="ramble">
<li>Create a clear visual hierarchy.</li>
<li>Nest text to show what belongs to what</li>
<li>Clearly define portions of a page.</li>
<li> It should be very clear what is clickable</li>
<li> Try and avoid "noise".</li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Lessons Learned:
</h2>
  <ul class="ramble">
    <li>Site ID is the highest and most important piece of a sites hierarchy </li>
    <li>Design should be self-evident and if that’s not possible, make it self-explanatory.</li>
    <li>It’s not the number of clicks, but how much lag time in between the clicks. </li>
  </ul>
