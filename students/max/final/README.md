## Project Description

I want to create a more robust and full version of my previous "Ad Agency Name Generator" site. In the new version, all the text will be generated in JS, instead of hiding and showing HTML divs. It won't be limited to just acronyms, instead it'll randomly alternate, sometimes generating an acronym, sometimes generating full words. The design/styling of the names will also change with every click. 

## Project Requirements

1 HTML, 1 CSS, 1 JS. I don't foresee using any images, just CSS styling, but we'll see.

## Plan for Mobile Differences

The text size and styling of the names that are generated will adapt to smaller screens.
