[Assignment details](/homework/final)

Edit this document on GitHub. _Only edit the text in parentheses._ Feel free to add more at the bottom.

## Project Description

I want to create a more robust and full version of my previous "Ad Agency Name Generator" site. In the new version, all the text will be generated in JS, instead of hiding and showing HTML divs. It won't be limited to just acronyms, instead it'll randomly alternate, sometimes generating an acronym, sometimes generating full words. The design/styling of the names will also change with every click. 

## Project Requirements

1 HTML, 1 CSS, 1 JS. I don't foresee using any images, just CSS styling, but we'll see.

## Plan for Mobile Differences

The text size and styling of the names that are generated will adapt to smaller screens.

# Feedback

- see example files
- 3 arrays, for letters, words, CSS classes
- 1 click listener to kick off randomizer function
- (optional) many smaller functions for different paths
- current design looks good
- stretch goal: diffrent arrays for words types, eg adj then noun

## For next week

- make sure you have variable numbers of letters working
- have at least 2 styles chosen at random
- randoming adding slashes
