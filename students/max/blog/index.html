    After having taken(and been mostly bored by) a UX class last quarter, I found the first few chapters—that were really more about human nature than web design—to be the most interesting. The idea that essentially no one cares very much about what we have to say is something I've been thinking about a lot lately, and I think it's especially important in our industry. There's an "expectation vs reality" that happens, where we make decisions with our work as if everyone cares about it as much as we do, when in reality that's never the case. The biggest takeaway for me was that everyone's on their own mission that you can't plan for, so the best you can do is either:
    </div>

    <div class="bodycopy">
    Make the "onboarding" process of getting onto your mission as seamless as possible.
    </div>

    <div class="bodycopy">
    Or make the work as interesting and prominent as possible, so that people <span class="italic"> want </span> to forget about your mission and go check out yours.
  </div>
