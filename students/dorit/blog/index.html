    <!--the post's text  -->
    I read this book about a year ago, while taking a web design class.
    I remember enjoying then, because it was very clear and entertaining, as well
    as useful, which is great for books and for websites. Rereading it now
    has not changed my impressions. The first five chapters talk about
    the importance and the ways in which websites can be made
    as easy to navigate as possible.
    More specifically, the first chapter tells us we should make everything
    on the webpage obvious. The second chapter tells us why we should do it.
    Chapters 3-5 specify ways to make things as obvious as can be.
      <br>
      <br>

      Here's a list of goals:
      <ul>
        <li>The first thing you should do is try to make things as self evident
         as possible</li>
         <li>If things cannot be made self evident, they should at least base
           self explanatory</li>
        <li>The user is going to treat your website as a billboard, so design
          a great billboard</li>
      </ul>

      Here's how to achieve these goals:
      <ol>
        <li>Use conventions</li>
        <li>Give clear and easy choices</li>
        <li>Avoid "happy talk"</li>
      </ol>
