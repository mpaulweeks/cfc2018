    I watched the video "General AI Won't Want You to Fix Its Code".
    </br>
    Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l7Is6vOAOA&feature=youtu.be">a link</a> to the video itself.

      It was interesting to hear and think about the similarities between AI and
      humans in that we don't want to be fixed, even if "someone" thinks it's for
      the better. But this video in itself did not raise particular fears in me.
      However, it did prompt me to watch another video,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcdVC4e6EV4">"Deadly Truth
      of General AI?"</a>,
      which, in conjunction with the first, did raise a fear. We tell AI to do
      something, and it does it the best way it can. This means that in can do it
      in ways that we can't necessarily predict, which could end up in our
      destruction. And if we realize it, we can't fix it, because it doesn't want
      to be fixed. So there.
  </div>
  <div class="textblock hidden" id="thingsThatExcite">
      There's actually nothing I'm too excited about with regard to AI. Especially
      not from this video. I guess it can potentially do a lot of great things, but since
      this video didn't talk about it, well, what can I say?
  </div>
  <div class="textblock hidden" id="questions">
      I guess the main question I would have is what do you do, then? If you
      build a machine that doesn't want to be fixed, but you can't build it perfect
      in the first try, what do you do? Is it worth messing with it? I'm not
      a technophobe, but these videos did raise a slight fear of something I never
      particularly thought about before. I guess that's what all this research
      is for.
  </div>
  <div class="textblock hidden" id="criticism">
      This video wasn't particularly clear to me on my first watch. In fact,
      without watching the other video,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcdVC4e6EV4">"Deadly Truth
      of General AI?"</a>, I wouldn't have understood much of it.
