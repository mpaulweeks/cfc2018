## Project Description

Changed my mind. I'm thinking of combining this project with one I am going to make for my Tuesday afternoon class. This way I will have more time to work on it.
It will be an interactive map of Manhattan and its pigeons and sweet treats. I'm thinking a toggle between the two categories, and pop up windows when you click on certain details. Also zoomimg in and out.

## Project Requirements

1 html file
1 css file
1 js file

## Plan for Mobile Differences

I think it should work on mobile as well.

# Feedback

- either map or portfolio is ok
- you can get floating pigeon/treats with position: relative, then position: absolute (see example.html)
- you can get context clicking with floating invisible divs

## For next week

- Get map or portfolio POC working with only 2-3 assets/calls to action
