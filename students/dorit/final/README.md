## Project Description

The website will be a game called Turdy Birds. It will have a character at the bottom whose movement the user can control (i.e., move left or right) and moving "birds" that will fly at the top and deposit poop. The goal of the player is to avoid the poop falling from above. 
If poop hits you, you die.

## Plan for Mobile Differences
